# JavaScript Practice Repository

Welcome to my **JavaScript Practice** repository! This repository is a collection of code snippets, exercises, and small projects that I am working on to improve my JavaScript skills. I push new code to this repository **daily**, showcasing my progress, learning, and exploration of JavaScript concepts.

## ðŸš€ Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to:
- **Track my progress** as I learn JavaScript.
- **Practice coding** by solving various problems and challenges.
- **Learn new concepts** and deepen my understanding of JavaScript.
- **Experiment with different techniques**, libraries, and frameworks.
  
## ðŸ“… Daily Coding Challenges

Each day, I work on solving different JavaScript problems, ranging from:
- Basic exercises (loops, conditionals, functions)
- Array and object manipulation (e.g., `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`)
- Algorithm and data structure problems (e.g., sorting, searching)
- Small projects and applications

The goal is to practice and improve my problem-solving skills and understand core JavaScript concepts.
